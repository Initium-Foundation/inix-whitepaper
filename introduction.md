# Introduction

The economic model of any new digital currency or asset (a.k.a. crypto economics or tokenomics) is one of the platforms on which the asset resides. This is especially true for the native token of a self-sovereign, permissionless blockchain network like Initium. This whitepaper discusses the crypto economics of the Initium Native Token, called INITIUM with the symbol of $INIX. Whether it's written **INITIUM** or **$INIX**, they both refer to the Initium Native Token. This whitepaper is broken down into several sections as followings;&#x20;

* [**Section 1 (Key Concepts)**](broken-reference) **** will discuss the critical properties of $INIX and its usescases in two different eras of the Initium project's chronology: Pre-Genesis and Post-Genesis.&#x20;
* ****[**Section 2 (Governance)**](broken-reference) will discuss the DAOs of the Initium ecosystem, the protocol governing law (Constitution), and the governance models in the initium chronology.&#x20;
* ****[**Section 3 (Pre-Genesis Tokenomics)**](broken-reference) will discuss the crypto economics of $INIX in the Pre-Genesis era, including the distribution of the initial supply, sales allocations to investors, ecosystem allocations, and the staking mechanism and rewards.
* ****[**Section 4 (Post-Genesis Tokenomics)**](broken-reference) will discuss the crypto economics of $INIX in the Post-Genesis era, the minting mechanism and its schedule, the staking mechanism and rewards, and the transaction fees.&#x20;
