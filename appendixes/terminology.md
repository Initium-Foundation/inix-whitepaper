# Terminology

## A

### _Airdrop_

In the cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem, the term "Airdrop" refers to the distribution of digital assets to the public, either by holding a specific other token or simply by being an active wallet address on a particular blockchain. This is separate and distinct from the allocation of tokens or coins that happen via a sales event. The digital asset being offered is typically purchased using an alternate token during sales. In the case of airdrops, the recipient requires no purchase, meaning that the assets are distributed for free. Airdrops are often used as a marketing tool to raise awareness of the coin or token being distributed and diversify the number of holders of that asset.&#x20;

### _Annual Percentage Yield (APY)_

The annual percentage yield (APY) is the real rate of return earned on an investment, considering the effect of compounding interest. Unlike simple interest, compounding interest is calculated periodically, and the amount is immediately added to the balance. With each period going forward, the account balance gets a little bigger, so the interest paid on the balance also gets bigger.

* APY is the actual rate of return that will be earned in one year if the interest is compounded.
* Compound interest is added periodically to the total invested, increasing the balance. That means each interest payment will be larger based on the higher balance.
* The more often interest is compounded, the higher the rate will be.

The formula for calculating APY is $$APY = (1+r/n)^{n-1}$$, where $$r$$ is period rate and $$n$$ is number of compounding periods.

### _Allocation_

Allocation is an allotment of tokens or equity that may be earned, purchased, or set aside for a certain investor, team, group, organization, or other related entity.

### _Application Programming Interface (API)_

An application programming interface, or API, is a piece of code that allows two applications to share information. The API enables the information to be exchanged quickly and easily despite the aggregator site and the hotel system being built with different technology and by different companies.

### _Auction_

Auctions are live events where various items, ranging from furniture to real estate, can be purchased through bidding. When the item is first presented at the auction, the auctioneer (person responsible for leading and managing the bidding process) will pitch a starting bid to the audience. Once bidding begins, interested persons will offer competing bids until no one is willing to go any higher with their bid price. Once the auctioneer recognizes the final bid, that person will be declared the highest bidder. The auction concludes with the highest bidder paying for and claiming the item. A sizable number of potential buyers is usually desired, as this may result in the bids being driven up to higher values for an optimal sale.



## _BEP-20_

BEP-20 is a token standard on Binance Smart Chain that extends ERC-20, the most common Ethereum token standard. You can think of it as a blueprint for tokens that defines how they can be spent, who can spend them, and other rules for their usage. Due to its similarity to Binance Chain’s BEP-2 and Ethereum’s ERC-20, it’s compatible with both.

### _Beta Code_

Later stage prototype computer code, programs, and algorithms meant to solve a problem and/or provide digital goods or services. Beta code comes with the expectation that the code has more functionality and stability than a mid-to-late stage prototype stage with a Beta testing phase and that the software functionality, features, and security may still be limited.

### _Bitcoin_

In short, Bitcoin is a digital form of money that runs on a distributed network of computers (nodes). In a broader sense, though, many people often use the word Bitcoin to refer to a few different things: a digital currency, a decentralized public ledger, a protocol, or simply the big ecosystem that encompasses all of these. However, there are some fundamental differences between these&#x20;

### _Block_

In short, the term block refers to computer files that store transaction data. These blocks are arranged in a linear sequence that forms an endless chain of blocks - hence, the term blockchain. So all information about blockchain transactions is gathered and recorded inside these blocks, and every newly generated block is connected to the previous one through the use of cryptographic techniques. The chain of linked blocks stores all the transaction data generated since the launch of a particular blockchain. So the records go back to the first block, which is called block zero or genesis block. The number of confirmed blocks is denoted as the block height functionalities.

### _Block Reward_

This incentivizes the validators to keep the Initium network more secure and increase their uptime. The _Inflation Schedule determines the block reward_ and is subject to halving every four years. The initial _Block Reward_ will be 1 or 2.5 $INIX (depending on final implementation) in the first four years and zero after 44 years. 90% of block rewards are added to Staking Rewards Pool, while 10% is allocated to the Initium Foundation for developing the ecosystem.&#x20;

### _Blockchain_

Blockchain transactions occur within a peer-to-peer network of globally distributed computers (nodes). Each node maintains a copy of the blockchain and contributes to the functioning and security of the network. This makes $INIX a decentralized digital currency that is borderless, censorship-resistant, that does not require third-party intermediation.

As a distributed ledger technology (DLT), the blockchain is intentionally designed to be highly resistant to modification and frauds (such as double-spending). This is true because the Bitcoin blockchain, as a database of records, cannot be altered, nor can it be tampered with no impractical amount of electricity and computational power - which means the network can enforce the concept of "original" digital documents, making each Bitcoin a very unique and un-copyable form of digital currency.

### _Bounty_

The term bounty refers to a reward posted by a group or individual to incentivize certain work, behavior, or development. For instance, referral programs may be considered a kind of bounty. In the context of cryptocurrencies, a bounty program is a marketing strategy used by startups during their initial coin offering (ICO) campaigns. It allows them to allocate a certain percentage of their coin’s supply to promote their project.

## C

### _CEX_

A CEX is a Centralized Exchange with a physical address and a corporate structure. Like other CeFi businesses, a CEX must follow all applicable laws, rules, money transmitter licenses, and regulations in each country, state, or region in which they operate. There are significant overhead costs in running a CEX, including Corporate leaders, labor, rent and electricity, office supplies, significant legal expenses, and expensive money transmitter licenses to be able to operate in chosen countries, states, or regions.

### _Circulating Supply_

The circulating supply refers to the coins that are accessible to the public and should not be confused with the total supply or max supply. The total supply is used to quantify the number of coins in existence, i.e., the number of coins that were already issued minus the coins that were burned. The total supply is the sum of the circulating supply and the tokens that are locked up in escrow. On the other hand, the max supply quantifies the maximum amount of coins that will ever exist, including the coins that will be mined or made available in the future.

### _Codex_

A record in the [Initium](terminology.md#initium-1) ledger that either holds data or is an executable craft. Like an account at a traditional bank, an Initium codex may hold funds called [leptons](terminology.md#lepton). Like a file in Linux, it is addressable by a key, often referred to as a public key.

### _Composability_

The measure of the usability and ability of the product to be used as a building block (or "money lego") in the construction of other products or domains. A simple, powerful, and that functions well with other protocols would be considered to have high composability.

### _Confirmation Time_

Confirmation time is defined as the time elapsed between when a blockchain transaction is submitted to the network and the time it is finally recorded into a confirmed block.&#x20;

### _Constitution_

A native craft in the Initium that manage the Initium protocol. Every rule in the constitution is a Regula. Some Regulas are governable, while some of them are permanent.&#x20;

### _Covenant_

Covenant is the consenses of Initium. It is a stack of proofs that each of them proves that some data existed before the proof was created and that a precise duration of time passed before the previous proof. It's a compound consensus using proof-of-uptime and proof-of-correctness as the Proof of Synchronization (PoSync) along with the Proof of Time (POT).  Like a [VDF](terminology.md#verifiable-delay-function-vdf), a proof can be verified in less time than it took to produce.

### Craft

A craft is an Initium compatible program. The code that interprets [instructions](terminology.md#instruction).

## D

### Decentralized Application (DApp)

A 21st-century invention, a dApp is a decentralized Web3 application that normally runs on a blockchain. The advantages of dApps are that: they allow for new solutions to problems, they are decentralized and are thus rugged, and they are resistant to outages and censorship.

dApps can provide decentralized software application services - such as the Brave browser - but they can also be used to trace and track goods and can be used to enable international financial transactions without the delay, costs, and hassle of middlemen and bureaucracy. They can also be a keystone to the functionality of complex decentralized exchanges and crypto financial services such as price oracles.

### _Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)_

The acronym DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization. A DAO is a system of hard-coded rules that define which actions a decentralized organization will take. However, the term DAO may also refer specifically to an organization called “The DAO,” which was conceptualized on the Ethereum blockchain back in 2016.

Simply put, a DAO refers to a particular kind of organization that, unlike conventional companies, is based on open source code and is operated entirely by its community. Therefore, the underlying structure and working mechanisms of a DAO are not based on any kind of hierarchical management (which are quite common in traditional businesses).

### _Decentralized Exchange (DEX)_

\
An exchange that does not require users to deposit funds to start trading and does not hold the funds for the user. Instead, users trade directly from their own wallets.&#x20;

### _Decentralized Finance (DeFi)_

DeFi stands for “decentralized finance” and refers to the ecosystem comprised of financial applications that are being developed on top of blockchain systems. DeFi may be defined as the movement promoting the use of decentralized networks and open-source software to create multiple types of financial services and products. The idea is to develop and operate financial DApps on top of a transparent and trustless framework, such as permissionless blockchains and other peer-to-peer (P2P) protocols.

### _Dis-Inflation_

It refers to a series of mechanisms and measures (e.g., fee burning or reducing the [block reward](terminology.md#block-reward)) for reducing the [Inflation Rate ](terminology.md#inflation-rate)effect on the [Total Current Supply](terminology.md#total-current-supply).&#x20;



## E

### _Effective Inflation Rate_

The observed [Inflation Rate](terminology.md#inflation-rate) on the Initium network after accounting for other factors that might decrease the [_Total Current Supply_](terminology.md#total-current-supply). There are various factors affecting this rate, including;

* [Block Rewards](terminology.md#block-rewards)
* Additional factors such as loss of private keys and slashing events should also be considered in a holistic analysis of the _Effective Inflation Rate_. For example, it’s estimated that 10-20% of all BTC have been lost and are unrecoverable and that networks may experience similar yearly losses at the rate of 1-2%.&#x20;
* Imperium DAO would decide on the burning of some portion of the Initium Foundation reserves via proposals. In case of the approval of such proposals, the burning of some portion of the Initium Foundation's reserves will take place.&#x20;

### _Epoch_

In a computing context, an epoch is a date and time relative to which a computer's clock and timestamp values are determined. The epoch traditionally corresponds to 0 hours, 0 minutes, and 0 seconds (00:00:00) Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) on a specific date, which varies from system to system. Most versions of Unix, for example, use January 1, 1970, as the epoch date; Windows uses January 1, 1601; Macintosh systems use January 1, 1904, and Digital Equipment Corporation's Virtual Memory System (VMS) uses November 17, 1858.

In Initium terminology, the epoch is the length of a certain amount of blocks (in Initium: “slots”) in which the validator schedule of Initium's consensus algorithm is defined. To stakers, this means that beginning and stopping for staking, as well as reward distribution, always happen when epochs switch over.

### _ERC-20_

ERC-20 is a technical standard to issue and implement tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It was proposed in November 2015 by Ethereum developer Fabian Vogelsteller. The standard describes a common set of rules that should be followed for a token to function properly within the Ethereum ecosystem.



## F

### _Finality_

Finality is the assurance or the guarantee that cryptocurrency transactions cannot be altered, reversed, or canceled after they are completed. The latency level of a blockchain will ultimately affect the chain's finality rate. Initium is proposed to have the shortest time to finality.&#x20;

### _Full Node_

A computer that fully implements the entirety of rules of an underlying blockchain network and completely validates transactions and blocks on a blockchain.

## G

### _Gas_

The term gas refers to the pricing mechanism used on the Ethereum network. Such a mechanism calculates the costs (fees) for performing a transaction or executing a smart contract operation.&#x20;

### _Genesis Block_

The genesis block is the first-ever block recorded on its respective blockchain network, also occasionally referred to as Block 0 or Block 1. When a block is broadcasted to the blockchain, it references the previous block. However, in the case of the genesis block, there is no previous block to reference.

### Genesis Event

Refers to the first event of the [Genesis Year](terminology.md#genesis-year) by which the [genesis block](terminology.md#genesis-block) of [Initium](terminology.md#initium-1) is generated, and the mainnet will be launched.&#x20;

### Genesis Year

In [Initium Chronology](terminology.md#initium-chronology), it refers to the first year of the launching of the Initium mainnet. The Genesis Year is a [Post-Genesis](terminology.md#post-genesis) era.&#x20;

### Go

Go (_GoLang_) is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is syntactically similar to C but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency

### _Governance_

Governance refers to the control and use of a Governance coin, token, and/or project through various measures to grow the ecosystem or product and to maximize gains for governance token holders.

### _Governance Token_&#x20;

A token is used to govern the operations and influence the direction of a coin, token, and/or project controlled by the Governance Token. Holding these tokens is often profitable through direct price appreciation of popular governance tokens but may come with other benefits that are only available to governance token holders and voters. Examples of governance tokens are MKR and YFI.

## H

### _Halving_

In the cryptocurrency space, the term halving refers to a process that reduces the issuance rate of new coins. More precisely, halving is the periodical reduction of the block subsidy provided to miners. The halving ensures that a crypto asset will follow a steady issuance rate until its maximum supply is eventually reached.

### Hard Cap

For an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), the term hard cap refers to the upper limit on the number of tokens that can be sold. It relates to the maximum amount of funds the development team is willing to collect in exchange for their tokens during that early stage of funding.&#x20;

For a token, the term hard cap refers to the maximum cap of the token that can be minted.&#x20;

### HODL

HODL is a term commonly used by cryptocurrency investors that refuse to sell their cryptocurrency regardless of the price increasing or decreasing. It is more frequently used during a bear market when people refuse to sell their coins despite the price drop.&#x20;

### HODLer

One who HODLs.

## I

### _Imperium_ DAO

The main DAO in the Initium ecosystem governs the initium protocol's Constitution.&#x20;

### _Inflation Rate_&#x20;

The Initium protocol will automatically mint new tokens on a predetermined [Inflation Schedule ](terminology.md#inflation-schedule)(discussed below). The _Inflation Rate_ is the annualized growth rate of the [Total Current Supply ](terminology.md#total-current-supply)at any point in time.&#x20;

### Inflation Schedule

Refers to the deterministic description of INIX token issuance over time. The Initium Foundation is proposing a dis-inflationary _Inflation Schedule_. I.e. Inflation starts at its highest value, the rate reduces over time until stabilizing at a predetermined long-term inflation rate (see discussion below). Three factors completely and uniquely parameterize this schedule:

* **Initial Inflation Rate**: The starting _Inflation Rate_ for when inflation is first enabled. This rate results from minting new tokens in the first cycle (four years after the Genesis event). The token minting rate can only decrease from this point.
* **Dis-inflation Rate**: The rate at which the _Inflation Rate_ is reduced.
* **Long-term Inflation Rate**: The stable, long-term _Inflation Rate_ is expected.

### _Initial Supply_

Refers to the supply of the tokens generated during the $INIX TGE. The initial supply will be 500,000,000 (five hundred million) $INIX.&#x20;

### _INITIUM_

INITIUM is the [native token](terminology.md#native-token) of the [Initium](terminology.md#initium-1). Before launching the mainnet of the Initium, INITIUM will be in the form of tokens on various blockchain networks, including Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, etc. See [INIX](terminology.md#inix).&#x20;

### _Initium_&#x20;

When written as Initium, it refers to the Initium protocol.&#x20;

### _Initium Bridge_

The Initium Bridge (RedWrap) is a native application of the Initium for converting the INIX and the other tokens on the Initium to compatible versions with the different blockchains, e.g., Ethereum, BSC, Polygone, etc. The Initium Bridge commercial name is RedWrap and will be available on [https://wrap.red](https://wrap.red).&#x20;

### _Initium Chronology_

It refers to the different eras in the Initium ecosystem lifecycle. There are three eras as [Pre-Genesis](terminology.md#pre-genesis), Genesis Year, and [Post-Genesis](terminology.md#post-genesis). See also [Genesis Event](terminology.md#genesis-event).&#x20;

### _Initium Genesis_

Refers to the main version of the [Initium](terminology.md#initium-1) by which the mainnet of the Initium blockchain will be launched. See [Versions Design](broken-reference).&#x20;

### _$INIX_

$INIX is the symbol of [INITIUM](terminology.md#initium), the native token of the  Initium network.

### _$INIX TGE_

Refers to the Token Generation Event of the token, by which the [initial supply](terminology.md#initial-supply) of the [$INIX](terminology.md#usdinix) will be generated and distributed among the owners.&#x20;

### _Instruction_

The smallest contiguous unit of execution logic in a [_craft_](terminology.md#craft). An instruction specifies which craft it is calling, which codex it wants to read or modify, and additional data that serves as an auxiliary input to the craft.

## J

## K

### _Know Your Customer (KYC)_

KYC refers to a process that banks and other financial institutions use to gather identifying data and contact information from current and potential customers. Its purpose is to prevent fraud, money laundering, and other illicit activity, as well as the misuse of financial accounts.

In the US, Banks are legally mandated to use KYC in compliance with the 2001 USA Patriot Act. In 1989, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) was established to fight money laundering on an international scale. FAFT sets standards and provides recommendations to accomplish this goal through Anti-Money Laundering (AML) practices. Member countries and jurisdictions enforce various laws, rules, and regulations to work with the AML guidelines. KYC and AML go hand-in-hand in helping to prevent dishonest and criminal financial activity.

## L

### Latency

Latency in computing refers to the time delay between an input and the received output. It is inherent at all levels of computing, from the IO latency between the user and the computer to the network latency as data and information travel from a computer to servers around the world. In cryptocurrencies, latency can refer to two different time delays. The first is the latency in the network of a blockchain, and the second is the latency on an exchange.&#x20;

### _Lepton_

A fractional of the Initium native token, $INIX, with the value of 0.000000000001 ($$10^{-12}$$) $INIX.

## M

## Mainnet

Mainnet is the term used to describe when a blockchain protocol is fully developed and deployed, meaning that cryptocurrency transactions are being broadcasted, verified, and recorded on a distributed ledger technology (blockchain). Hadron is the mainnet of the Initium blockchain.&#x20;

### Maximum Cap

See [Maximum Supply](terminology.md#maximum-supply).&#x20;

### Maximum Supply

The maximum supply of a cryptocurrency refers to the maximum number of coins or tokens that will be ever created. This means that once the maximum supply is reached, there won’t be any new coins mined, minted, or produced in any other way. See [Hard Cap](terminology.md#hard-cap).&#x20;



## N

### Native Coin

See [Native Token](terminology.md#native-token).&#x20;

### Native Token

Also known as the native coin, the native token is the primary token of a blockchain or ecosystem, which is used for various purposes like paying transaction fees, receiving staking rewards, voting, and governance. For example, Ether (ETH) is the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, BNB is the native token of BSC and Binance Exchange, and AAVE is the native token of AAVE Protocol. A native token can be hosted on another blockchain (e.g., ERC-20 or BEP-20 tokens) or a coin using its dedicated blockchain.&#x20;

### Node

In the context of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, a node refers to each computer running the blockchain protocol. So a blockchain network like Initium is made up of thousands of computer nodes spread around the world, and this is what makes Initium a peer-to-peer, distributed economic system.

### Non-fungible Token (NFT)

A non-fungible token (NFT) is a type of cryptographic token that represents a unique asset. NFTs are tokenized versions of digital or real-world assets. They function as verifiable proofs of authenticity and ownership within a blockchain network. NFTs are not interchangeable with each other and introduce scarcity to the digital world.

## O

### Off-Chain

Transactions that occur in a given blockchain network may be later reported or batched together before being submitted to the main chain.

## P

### Pool

A smart contract containing shared amounts of assets provided by depositors.&#x20;

### Post-Genesis

A Period in the [Initium Chronology](terminology.md#initium-chronology) refers to the period after the Genesis Event in the Initium blockchain. It also includes the [Genesis Year](terminology.md#genesis-year) and [Genesis Event](terminology.md#genesis-event).&#x20;

### Pre-Genesis

A Period in the [Initium Chronology](terminology.md#initium-chronology) refers to the period between the end of the $INIX official token sales course and the launch of the Initium mainnet.

### Protocol

In High Technology, a protocol is a set of developed rules or specifications. These rules detail definitions, standards, limitations, and potential stipulations. Examples of technology protocols include TCP/IP and ERC-20.

## Q

## R

### _Regula_

A parameter or a series of parameters in [Constitution](terminology.md#constitution) craft that manage the Initium protocol.&#x20;

### _ROI_

Return On Investment. The gains or losses on an investment. For example, doubling your investment in an asset would be a 100% gain, or 100% ROI. Losing all of your investment would be a 100% loss, or -100% ROI.

### _RedWarp_

Refers to the [Initium Bridge](terminology.md#initium-bridge). See [RedWap](broken-reference).&#x20;

### _Rich-gets-richer_

The rich-get-richer concern of PoS has been heavily debated in the blockchain community. The debate is centered around the argument of whether rich miners possessing more stakes will obtain higher staking rewards and further increase their potential income in the future. Initium protocol solves this issue inherently with the implementation of PoSync of Covenant. Furthermore, the staking rewards are distributed based on the $$U_{epoch}$$ of a given validator.

### _Rust_

Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language. Rust emphasizes performance, type safety, and concurrency. Rust enforces memory safety—that is, all references point to valid memory—without requiring using a garbage collector or reference counting present in other memory-safe languages.

## S

### _Slot_

The period for which each prime node ingests transactions and produces a [block](terminology.md#block). Collectively, slots create a logical clock. Slots are ordered sequentially and non-overlapping, comprising roughly equal real-world time as per [Covenant](terminology.md#covenant).&#x20;

### _Smart Contract_

A digital contract is programmed in a language that is considered Turing complete, meaning that with enough processing power and time, a properly programmed Smart Contract should be able to use its code base and logical algorithms to perform almost any digital task or process. Ethereum's programming languages, such as Solidity and Vyper, are Turing complete.

### _Stake_

The act of depositing a cryptocurrency coin or token into a yield farming project and/or protocol, whether the access to the project is either through DeFi methods.

### _Staking_

The act of staking a cryptocurrency deposit to yield farm additional cryptocurrency via DeFi staking offerings, programs, or projects.

## T

### _Testnet_

A testing network for a new coin, project, or product, or for potential improvements to an existing product or offer. Testnets are used to test the viability and vulnerability of new ideas, concepts, code, and processes prior to moving on to a production network or networks of some sort.

### _Total Current Supply_

The total amount of [$INIX](terminology.md#usdinix) tokens (locked or unlocked) that have been generated (via [genesis block](terminology.md#genesis-block) or [Inflation Schedule](terminology.md#inflation-schedule)) minus any tokens that have been burnt (via transaction fees or other mechanisms) or slashed. At the network launch, 500,000,000 [$INIX](terminology.md#usdinix) will be instantiated in the [genesis block](terminology.md#genesis-block). Since then, the Total Current Supply will be reduced by the partial burning of transaction fees and planned token reduction events. See [Inflation Schedule](terminology.md#inflation-schedule).&#x20;

### _Tuple_

In Rust, a tuple is **a collection of values of different types**. Tuples are constructed using `parentheses ()`and each tuple itself is a value with a type signature (T1, T2, ...)  where T1 and T2 are the types of its members. Functions can use tuples to return multiple values, as tuples can hold any number of values. You may need[ this article ](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1867/w11.pdf)for tuple-based coordination.&#x20;

## U

## V

### _Validator_&#x20;

A full participant in the Initium network that participates in a cluster to produce new blocks. A validator validates the transactions added to the ledger.

### _Verifiable Delay Function (VDF)_

A function that takes a fixed amount of time to execute. It produces the proof that it ran, which then can be verified in less time than it took to produce.

## W

### _Wallet_

A software or hardware cryptocurrency wallet that can hold a variety of tokens. Wallets may also be considered a cold wallet - meant to be used for long-term storage of crypto coins for security purposes or a hot wallet, which is considered more at risk than a cold wallet due to its inaccessibility (usually offline). A hot wallet is meant to be used for active or semi-active transactions in and out of that wallet, as well as a place to withdraw or add funds.

### _Wrapped $INIX ($wINIX)_

In the [Post-Genesis](terminology.md#post-genesis) period, it refers to the compatible version of the [$INIX](terminology.md#usdinix)  token in other blockchain networks. Users would be able to wrap their [$INIX](terminology.md#usdinix) tokens via [RedWrap](terminology.md#redwarp). &#x20;
