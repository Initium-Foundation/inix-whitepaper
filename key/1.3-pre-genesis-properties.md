# 1.3 Pre-Genesis Properties

By the $INIX TGE, the Pre-Genesis era will begin. During the Pre-Genesis period, the $INIX token is subject to the following properties:

* The total current supply of the $INIX token will equal the total supply minted in $INIX TGE.&#x20;
* Since the Initium mainnet is not yet launched, the $INIX token will be a multi-chain token hosted on various blockchains, including Ethereum, BSC, and Polygone.&#x20;
* $INIX tokens can be migrated from one blockchain to another using RedWrap (Initium Bridge). The smart contracts will use `mint` and `burn` functions to ensure the total current supply won't exceed the total supply minted in $INIX TGE.&#x20;
* Only the tokens subject to Public Sales Options (see in [3.3](../pre-gen/3.3-sales-allocations.md)) will be unlocked and traded on DEX and CEX platforms.&#x20;
* Other tokens are subject to the `locking_period` function in the $INIX token smart contract.&#x20;
* All unlocked $INIX tokens are subject to obtaining staking rewards based on pre-determined APY if staked.&#x20;
* The $INIX tokens of Sead Funding Sales, Private Investors Sales, Validator Staking Sales, Team, and Initium Foundation allocations are subject to vesting time (see in [3.3](../pre-gen/3.3-sales-allocations.md)).
* Sead Funding Sales (see in [3.3](../pre-gen/3.3-sales-allocations.md)), Team (see [3.5](../pre-gen/3.5-team-allocations.md)), and Ecosystem allocations (see [3.4](../pre-gen/3.4-ecosystem-allocations.md)) are exempted from staking rewards during the vesting time.&#x20;
* Governance of Initium DAOs will be based on the Pre-Genesis governance mechanism (see [2.4.1](../gov/2.4-governance-models.md#2.3.1-pre-genesis-governance-model)).&#x20;
