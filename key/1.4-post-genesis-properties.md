# 1.4 Post-Genesis Properties



By the **Genesis Event** (see[ 4.2](../schedule/5.6-genesis-event.md)), the mainnet of Initium will be available along with other parallel subnets, and the Post-Genesis era will begin. During the Post-Genesis era, the $INIX token is subject to the following properties:

* The $INIX token will migrate to the Initium chain and the term "$INIX" will be used only for the $INIX tokens running on the Initium blockchain.&#x20;
* The $INIX tokens generated by $INIX TGE need to be converted to new %INIX tokens (compatible with Initium blockchain) to be eligible for staking. The conversion will be done using RedWrap (Initium Bridge) and or by the supported centralized exchanges (CEXs).&#x20;
* The $INIX tokens can be converted to $wINIX (the wrapped version of $INIX) to be used on the other blockchain networks. The wrapping function can be done using RedWrap (Initium Bridge).&#x20;
* Mining new $INIX tokens (see [4.3](../post-gen/4.3-minting-mechanism.md)) will add new supplies to the Total Current Supply of $INIX tokens to reach the hardcap (see [4.4](../post-gen/4.4-inflation-schedule.md)).&#x20;
* Staking $INIX tokens will be enabled by validators. The HODLers of $INIX tokens can stake their tokens using validators or platforms running Initium validators.&#x20;
* Staking rewards will be set by the dynamism discussed in the staking mechanism (see [4.5](../post-gen/4.5-staking-mechanism.md)).
* Transaction fees will be paid in leptons, the smalled amount of $INIX (see [4.6](../post-gen/4.6-transaction-fees.md)).
* Governance of Initium DAOs will be based on the Post-Genesis governance mechanism (see [2.4.2](../gov/2.4-governance-models.md#2.3.2-post-genesis-governance-model)).
