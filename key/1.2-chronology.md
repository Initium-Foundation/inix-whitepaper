# 1.2 Chronology

Initium network is subject to a timeline of events called Chronology. Based on Initium chronology, the $INIX token will have different usecases and entities. Initium chronology is scheduled as below:

### **1.3.1) Pre-Genesis**

**R**efers to the period from the $INIX token TGE ($INIX TGE) until the **Genesis Event** (see[ 4.2](../schedule/5.6-genesis-event.md)). During this period, the Initium blockchain is under construction. During this period, the Initium blockchain may be released in a laboratory version called Inanis and test versions, including Primus and Argonaut. These versions are just for testing the Initium network before launch and should not be considered the primary version.&#x20;

### **1.3.2) Post-Genesis**

Refers to the period starting from the **Genesis Event** (see[ 4.2](../schedule/5.6-genesis-event.md)). by which the main version of the Initium protocol, the **Initium Genesis**, is released and the mainnet of the Initium network is activated. Validators will become active by the Genesis Event, the genesis block will be mined, and the mining of new $INIX tokens will occur based on the Inflation mechanism. $INIX will reach its maximum cap (hardcap) in 44 after the Genesis Event.&#x20;
