# 1.5 Proposed Usecases

As the native token of the Initium protocol, the $INIX token will play an essential role in the ecosystem's success and network security. The proposed usecases of $INIX tokens are (but are not limited to) as followings:

* Transaction fees on Initium mainnet and subnets (see [4.6](../post-gen/4.6-transaction-fees.md)).
* Staking during the Pre-Genesis era for obtaining staking rewards (see [3.6](../pre-gen/3.6-staking-mechanism.md)).
* Securing the Initium network by staking the $INIX tokens (see [4.5](../post-gen/4.5-staking-mechanism.md)).
* Means of payments in the Initium Ecosystem (see Initium Ecosystem Whitepaper).
* Minting NFTs on Initium protocol.&#x20;
* Providing the liquidity for other tokens minted on the Initium network. &#x20;
* Governance of the Initium protocol (see [2.4](../gov/2.4-governance-models.md)).&#x20;
* Empowering the Initium community and the projects joining the Initium ecosystem (see[ 3.4](../pre-gen/3.4-ecosystem-allocations.md)).
* Building the Initium Ecosystem (see Initium Ecosystem Whitepaper).&#x20;
