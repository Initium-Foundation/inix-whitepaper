# 1.1 Key Properties

There are the critical takeaway properties of the design of the $INIX economics model, including:

* The resources spent by a validator for staking are proportional to that validator's total stake.&#x20;
* The rewards accumulated by a validator are proportional to that validator's total stake.&#x20;
* There are two different eras for the $INIX token according to the Initium chronology (discussed in section [1.2](1.2-chronology.md)).
* $INIX has an initial supply of 500,000,000 (500M) and is a capped-supply token, with a maximum cap of 1,130,720,000 (1,130.72M) tokens (discussed in section [3.2](../pre-gen/3.2-initial-supply-distribution.md)).&#x20;
* The minting of new $INIX tokens after the Genesis Event will take place based on validators' activities for mining new blocks. Since the newly minted $INIX tokens will be eventually distributed to the validators (discussed in section [4.3](../post-gen/4.3-minting-mechanism.md)).&#x20;
* While capped, $INIX is still governable. The rate at which the maximum cap is reached is subject to governance (discussed in section [4.3](../post-gen/4.3-minting-mechanism.md))
* The holders of $INIX tokens (HODLers) can stake their $INIX tokens on the validators to obtain staking rewards. This enables the validators to get more transaction fees, prime node, and supervisor node status and enhances the security of the Initium network.&#x20;
* Validators that lock their stakes for longer will be rewarded more.&#x20;
* Validators are incentivized to stay online and operate correctly as their rewards are based on their participation in validator squads (for receiving transaction fees) and Posyc concensus of Covenant (for receiving staking rewards). Therefore, there is no "rich-gets-richer" compounding effect (discussed in section [4.5](../post-gen/4.5-staking-mechanism.md))
* A protocol-based Constitution and govern $INIX validators, and HODLers can cast their votes for modifying it based on the Initium network circumstances.&#x20;
* Fees are distributed to both validators participating in the cluster, and the validators lock their $INIX tokens based on their effective staked $INIX and Posync. This mechanism incentivizes more validators to be uptime and secure the Initium network (discussed in section [4.6](../post-gen/4.6-transaction-fees.md))
