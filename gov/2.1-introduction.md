# 2.1 Introduction

The Initium protocol is based on three main concepts: security, scalability, and decentralization. As discussed on the Initium Community Whitepaper, our community will be the leading entity for governing the Initium protocol.&#x20;

Therefore, the Initium community plays an essential role in the development, optimization, implementation, and adoption of Initium protocol to build a seamless ecosystem based on the Initium technology and the $INIX token.&#x20;

Section 2.2 will discuss the Initium DAOs and their role in the Initium protocol governance. Section 2.3 will discuss the Constitution, the protocol-based governance module of the Initium protocol, which controls the critical functions, and how the Initium community can alter/modify it. Section 2.4 will discuss the governance models during the Pre-Genesis and the Post-Genesis eras.

More information about the Initium governance is available in Initium Governmance Whitepaper.&#x20;
