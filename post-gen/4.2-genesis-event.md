# 4.2 Genesis Event

The Genesis Event is the most significant moment in the Initium network chronology as it refers to the generation of the Genesis block on the Hadron network and the official launch of the Initium protocol. By Genesis Event, Initium will enter a new era, called the Post-Genesis.&#x20;

Here the developers can launch their applications on the Initium protocol; thousands of transactions would occur every second on the Initium blockchain, the subnets are integrated with the Hadron network, and the ecosystem can develop quickly. The Genesis Event Inherits various issues from the Post-Genesis era, including a fast-growing community of developers and HODLers, and 500M $INIX tokens as the Total Current Supply (Approximately 44.70M $INIX as the Staking Rewards Reserve).

By the Genesis Event, the old $INIX tokens hosted on the other blockchains need to be converted to the new version of the $INIX token hosted on the Initium blockchain as its native token using the Initium Bridge (RedWrap).&#x20;

The Genesis Event changes the Total Current Supply of the $INIX token as it activates the Inflation Mechanism, which enables the minting of new $INIX tokens by the new blocks on the Initium (see section [4.3](4.3-minting-mechanism.md)). This turns the $INIX staking rewards into dynamic APY as discussed in section [4.5](4.5-staking-mechanism.md).&#x20;

The Genesis Event significantly affects the governance model as discussed in section [2.4.2](../gov/2.4-governance-models.md#2.4.2-post-genesis-governance-model).&#x20;
