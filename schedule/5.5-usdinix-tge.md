# 5.5 $INIX TGE

INITIUM Token Generation Event ($INIX TGE) refers to the event of launching the $INIX smart contracts on the partner blockchains, including Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, etc. The $INIX TGE is a Prime Event in the Initium chronology (see section [1.2](../key/1.2-chronology.md)) by which the Pre-Genesis era will begin. During this period, the Initium Foundation and Initium Lab, in participation with other developers, will develop the Initium Genesis and the subnets of the protocol to be ready for being launched on Genesis Event.&#x20;

Using the Chinese Almanac Calendar, we've selected 07 August 2023 (equal to the 21st day of the Sixth month in the Chinese Lunar Calendar) and the auspicious period between 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM GMT for the $INIX TGE.&#x20;

The Initium Foundation will announce further information If any change is applied to the planned $INIX TGE date and time.
